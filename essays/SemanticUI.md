## What You See is What You Get

People are super simple. Initially we judge based on appearance and sometimes that is the only interaction we get. If something does not look good we have a tendency to not want to look at it anymore. As children we are taught to not judge a book by its cover or to look at people for what is on the inside. Yet with much of our modern media it is the exact opposite. A great example of this is a typical journey while looking for a new app, something to kill some time. As you look into your respective app store you immediately judge every app based on what you see initially. Be it a screen shot or just a thumbnail. First impressions are everything and that is why it is so important to make it a great one.
