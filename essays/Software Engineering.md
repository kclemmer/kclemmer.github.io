## My Views on Software Engineering
I've determined that I am a rather bland person. I understand this and yet one of the most creative fields that I have ever seen is that of Software Engineering. It is more than the simple, "Here's a problem, now solve it", mentality. As I have explored just how far this subject seems to go I am constantly amazed by how many things people are doing with it. Originally when I had heard of the topic of Software Engineering I had assumed that it was a bunch of nerds in a room typing on computers and making programs to run machines. My current understanding leans closer to what I hope is reality of a bunch of nerds in their own rooms, working together to achieve a common goal. Mostly the things I have watched over the years were all regarding the video game industry. Mostly documentary types or reality shows, but they all showed just how passionate people could be about their work. 

## Hopes and Dreams
I hope that as I learn what Software Engineering really means I can develop the skills that will make me effective at it. Mostly though, I want to know how to collaborate. In any field you can only go so far on your own (unless you are a genius). Therefore it is most prudent to be able to work in a group, to collaborate. Most of the tools I had heard of, but due to the simple fact that I had no use for them yet, I hadn't learned much about them. Other than that, anything else would be welcomed mainly because there are just so many things that are necessary in order to become better, but coordination is my main goal.

## Parting Thoughts
I don't know what it is that I don't know. Once I find something that I need to learn in order to progress I tend to jump at the opportunity to learn it. It is my understanding that there will be many, many things to learn and I look forward to all of it.
