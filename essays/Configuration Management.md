## Configuration Management
As a concept Configuration Management is new to me. Till now I have not worked on many group projects. I have recently worked on a group project, and in that instance it was actually easier to not use git. In this instance I was more of an observer, but the rest of the group simply shared unity packages rather than attempt to sync things up on gitHub. I feel like this was a rather select situation and they even mentioned how its mainy unity that prevented their git usage.

## Popular
Popularity is such a relative thing. To say something is popular because of something else is relative within the group that was using it. From what I can figgure, once the idea of git was a thing it was popular within the realm of people that would find it useful, and that is all that really mattered at the time. Perhaps some people had issue with it, perhaps they were in the majority. In that case git as a concept would not be popular. I feel like GitHub streamlined all of this. Because of this ease of access, whatever disparity in numbers people had towards this concept would have been ironed out. So, I would say that git was popularized by GitHub.

## Foreshadowing 
There have been people who have mentioned that there are issues within this construct. Since I have not worked extensively with it I can only take their word for it. I look forward to the learning opertunity and hope to learn as much as I can about it.
