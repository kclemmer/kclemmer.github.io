## Configuration Management
As a concept Configuration Management is something new to me. Till now, I have not done many group oriented projects. I have had a few instances of group work and in one it was actually easier to not use git. In that particular instance, I was more of an observer, but they simply shared unity packages rather than attempt to sync things up on gitHub. I feel like this was  a rather select situation, and I can see how and when git would be a useful situation. 

## Popular
Popularity is such a relative thing. To say something is popular because of something else is rather difficult to be correct in saying. In my opinion once the idea of git was a thing it was popular within the realm of people that would find it useful. In the general sense of the word popular, being the world at large to those that may not have found the use for it, I feel like GitHub has made that happen. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter which came first, just a matter of if you find it useful or not.
