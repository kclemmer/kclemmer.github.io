## Gods

<img class="ui medium left floated image" src="../images/Rick_Sanchez.png">

Programmers are gods. We are the people who ultimately make the decision that affect everyday things that people deal with. As our lives become more and more dependent on the "smart" technology that keeps it going, we have to ask ourselves about the people that are coding the software that runs them. What role do they play in our lives? Is it that of a God? I would argue that to a degree this is the case. But from where is this power derived? Knowledge. Some of us have a greater understanding of a particular thing that happens to run the world. Many people have no understanding of what happens under the hood, so to speak, and as such revere those that are capable of creating such worlds with their fingertips as gods. The main problem is that because of this barrier, people have a general feeling that this information is beyond them and choose not to even attempt to understand it. Throughout all of time most of the problems societies faced revolved around ignorance. This is problem that needs to be addressed now. 

## With Great Power...

Those that know things have an obligation to dispurse information. A great example in history of the consolidation and control of information lies within Christianity. It was only with the invention of the printing press that the masses were able to access the word for themselves, and it was then that they started asking questions. An entire movement was formed around that idea, mainly the branching of Protestant Churches which one could argue lead to the creation of our great nation. In this sense, it was the information going out there and letting people ask questions. As they questioned things they saw problems finally, problems and questions they had no idea even existed until they were shown. The same thing applies today. Ignorance is the greatest enemy to modern society. Within every discipline we are faced with the same dilemma, "How do we educate". 

## What is Needed
A large reform is needed within our school systems. There needs to be a greater emphasis on the basics. The concepts displayed in software engineering are fundamentally not new ones.
