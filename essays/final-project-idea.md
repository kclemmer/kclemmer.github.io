# Students are Cheap

## Overview 
*The Problem:*
College students are generally strapped for funds and anything that saves them money is welcomed. However, most students are unaware of the ways in which they can save money.

*The Solution:*
*Students are Cheap* would be a directory in which students and faculty could post any saving opportunities that they feel would be useful.

The basic idea with this is a community driven database with ways that students can save money. Things that could be posted here include but are not limited to: textbooks, housing, deals on food, coupons, student friendly establishments, etc.

The main goals of this app are to connect less informed students with ways that they can reduce the costs associated with being a college student.


## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
<li>Public Landing Page</li>
<li>Login Page</li>
<li>User Dashboard</li>
<li>Totorial Page</li>
<li>Admin Homepage</li>
<li>Posting Page</li>
<li>Reputation System Page</li>
<li>Post Page</li>


## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
<li>New user goes to landing page, logs in, goes to userda totorial page, they read through that and then are sent to the user dashboard.(Gets them started)</li>
<li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets admin homepage, edits site.</li>
<li>User goes to post page, reads information, comments on post page.</li>
<li>User goes to dashboard, user selects add post, goes to posting page, adds a post.</li>


## Beyond the basics
