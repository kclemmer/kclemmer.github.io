## Craft The World
One of my favorite gametypes is the roguelike. There's just something about a game that is very harsh in its consequences but allows for you to keep part of what you've done. [Craft the World](http://store.steampowered.com/app/248390/) is one such game which borrows into this genre. This game can trace its roots back to the likes of [Dwarf Fortress,](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) but the main theme here is management. In this style of game you don't take direct control of the units you have to oversee. Instead you issue commands and watch them attempt to fulfill them. Sometimes I just feel like one of those minions attempting to heed my own commands.

## Windsor Knot
There is just something that just feels proper about a well done knot. It feels professional and it feels like a winner's knot. Yet for whatever reason most people just tie a half-windsor. I suppose it is easier, but it just looks sloppy. The main cause of this (in my opinion) is that people are unaware of the proper way to tie an actual Windsor Knot. Yet they are shown how to do a half-knot and told it is the real deal. 

## A Streak of Light
I feel like Meteor has a rather harsh learning curve. Yet I don't feel like I've found that yet. I think that my current exposure towards Meteor is just that, only exposure. I have not yet begun to fully realize its potential or its shortfalls.
