## Craft The World

One of my favorite gametypes is the roguelike. There's just something about a game that is very harsh in its consequences but allows for you to keep part of what you've done. [Craft the World](http://store.steampowered.com/app/248390/) is one such game which borrows into this genre. This game can trace its roots back to the likes of [Dwarf Fortress,](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) but the main theme here is management. In this style of game you don't take direct control of the units you have to oversee. Instead you issue commands and watch them attempt to fulfill them. Sometimes I just feel like one of those minions attempting to heed my own commands. Parts are understandable but the big picture is not.

## A Streak of Light

I feel like Meteor has a rather harsh learning curve. Yet I don't feel like I've found that yet. I think that my current exposure towards Meteor is just that, only exposure. I have not yet begun to fully realize its potential or its shortfalls. I've done some tutorials, I've followed instructions, but I still don't have a firm grasp as to what I am entirely doing. This will hopefully become clearer as I spend more time in this framework. I am currently a kid with his training wheels still but I will be riding on my own in no time. 

## Facing Future

Currently this is the only pair of glasses that I have. When it comes to application architecture I have only used the one pair. I hope to be able to compare this to other things very soon. I do like how it is structured though. The idea of giving everyone a copy of what they need makes sense. If you need the client to have a bit of data and you are sending it over and over, why not just store that locally and look their instead. Unfortunately this is the only bit of anything that I can see which is noteworthy about Meteor currently. I know that this is because I haven't explored the majority of it. I look forward to playing around with this in the future.
