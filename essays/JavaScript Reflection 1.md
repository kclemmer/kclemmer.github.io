*This is (relatively) new to me...*

## My Thoughts on JavaScript so Far
JavaScript has existed long before I ever thought it did and it was created by people who were[are] much smarter I am. Before taking ICS 314 I know that the name "JavaScript" might have crossed my brain on occasion because I know that I have talked with people that use it on a daily basis. In fact, I am fairly certain that there were times where I made the easily assumed connection between JavaScript and Java. However, in terms of learning it or even becoming familiar with it, I have not even had the inkling before now. Prior to this most recent learning, I had dabbled in a few other languages (Java, C, C++), but mostly those were introductory at best and I had never created with them on my own for my own purposes. Based on that knowledge and the relatively small amount of exposure that I have had to JavaScript thus far, I can say I like it the best. Yet, it is because of this lack of experience I can't comfortably say if this is a good language. The fact that most of the syntax does not seem to be quite so rigid is what I like the best. While I can appreciate a language that forces you to check each and every character that you type, a more of a free flowing feeling is a fresh change of pace. Especially in C it felt like the characters were all trying to get you.

In my ICS 314 class we had a module where we explored the JavaScript learning activities on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). This was my first real exposure to JavaScript. I found that their style of presenting the material to be engaging and at the time it felt like i was learning a lot. At times it seemed like it was just a rapid firing of information, covering many different aspects of JavaScript, but in retrospect, this was barely even a scratch on the surface. 

## My Thoughts on Athletic Software Engineering
I hadn't heard of Athletic Software Engineering either before ICS 314. So far it is an interesting activity. The idea of training your body to function comfortably in a high stress environment is not a new one, but to apply it in this way is. I have one complaint so far: I feel like just repeating the same activity(workout) will not help you in preparing for one that really counts. It's just like a puzzle. Once you solve the puzzle you're just going through the motions until you finish the task. This is why I see so much value in the extra practices provided by the TA. It offers a new problem. I personally feel like I need at least half a dozen unique, same aproximate difficulty level, and the same key objectives to meet in order to reach a semblence of proficiency. How to provide that at a class level I am uncertain. But I do know that in solving this problem those that perform all of the workouts will be much better off.
