## The Holy Wars

Well, perhaps not *that* long, but it has been a subject of discussion for a while now. Many people have added to this commentary over how code should be formatted. How are we to denote changes in our code? Different ways of writing code are easier to read than others! Should we use a or tab spaces instead? There are arguments from both sides which are rather compelling. The thing that I find most interesting is the lengths to which people will argue one way or another. While both sides have highly articulated arguments which make it almost impossible to choose, it is interesting to read all of the arguments. I find it much more interesting to be an observer to the battle than to be an active participant in it. After all, I have no horse in this race.

## Tab

I don't have any strong opinions on the matter. On the one hand you could press one button, on the other you could press a different button three times. This point was brought up in the show Silicon Vally. I must say **spoilers** at this point in case that sort of thing matters to you. The subject of an entire episode revolved around the main character in a relationship. The episode opens with him having a small discussion with his overseas team about the subject of tabs versus spaces. In it he attempts to be polite about it, but his anger is apparent when he basically calls the people using spaces less than human. His team agrees to use tabs, but they are honestly confused about the matter since they are basically the same thing in their opinion.

The one is a bit neurotic about the whole issue and thinks that it is simply barbaric for children to be brought into such a world. The other party responds by pressing her space bar repeatedly in a petty attempt to prove her correctness via repetition. After all, it's all the same once it goes through the compiler. He then responds with a physical metaphor of trying to apply tab to staircases. Needless to say, tabbing instead of taking the stairs normally results in his falling down them. But, the amount of keystrokes you use to do the same thing is an efficiency issue. These are some examples, but they clearly make the two stronger parts of their respective arguments.. 

## Space

I have never had to work with a large group of people and attempt to get them to agree on the same thing. The closest I've been is trying to get a few people to agree on the same thing for dinner. Formatting is a personal choice, but if everyone isn't on the same page the result just looks ugly. Not to say that clean is necessarily good, but at least it does not make you want to gouge out your eyes. It seems like there is no end in sight, but this will probably be solved around the same time we resolve racism.
