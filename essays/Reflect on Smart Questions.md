## Smart?
"Smart" is such a relative term. In today's society we look at those relative to ourselves and assign labels. However, looking back on history we can clearly see who was smart relative to the average at the time. With the advent of the internet, we can now have a history on a personal level. Every single keystroke and message that we post online has the potential to be etched into the annals of history. With that being said, anonymity has given rise to what we call trolls. People understand that it is generally very difficult to trace exactly who is who and who said what on the internet. This being best illustrated by the great webcomic Penny Arcade with their own [theory](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19) on the subject. 

## Questions!
With all of the hate that could potentially flow towards you, why would anyone even ask a question on the internet? The answer is that while there is mostly hate out there, occasionally there are some good things that trickle back. For this to happen, one must ask the question that one has in the correct way. This is especially prevalent for places where software developers congregate. [This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41727415/valid-but-worthless-syntax-in-switch-case) is an example of a good question. In this particular instance, the individual has found something. He shows what it is that he found, and asks what else there is that could be learned from it. What follows is a surprisingly civil discussion on the topic and people do their best to explain each and every aspect of the topic. The main thing that he does correct here is that he shows that he is willing to do work to find the answer, but reached a point where he could no longer find the information he was seeking, and then asked for help.

## Conversely...
[This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41719269/do-include-and-require-behave-in-same-way-in-case-the-file-specified-with-th) is an instance of what we would call a troll. Rather, the people attempting to answer his question quickly concluded that he was a troll. This is because his question was poorly asked. He follows up by saying confusing statements and being antagonistic towards those that were attempting to help him. In the end, it was understood that he was(is) a troll, and he wanted other people to do work for him. This general attitude does not sit well with most people and as such the response could be expected. The greatest thing that could be gleaned from all of this is attitude. If you can convey a positive attitude and ask good questions, you can get good responses and great answers.
