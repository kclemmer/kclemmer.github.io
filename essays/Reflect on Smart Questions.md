## Smart?
"Smart" is such a relative term. In today's society we look at those relative to ourselves and assign labels. However, looking back on history we can clearly see who was smart relative to the average at the time. With the advent of the internet, we can now have a history on a personal level. Every single keystroke and message that we post online has the potential to be etched into the annals of history. With that being said, anonymity has given rise to what we call trolls. People who understand that it is generally very difficult to trace exactly who is who and who said what on the internet. This being best illustrated by the great webcomic Penny Arcade with thier own [theory](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19) on the subject.
