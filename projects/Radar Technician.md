Radar technicians work on radars. You could have probably guessed that, but that statement barely scratches the surface of what those words mean. The school for being a radar technician in the military comes in three parts. Electronic Principles, Radar Fundamentals, and On the Job Training. They begin by introducing you to the world of electronics. This ranges from basic circuit diagrams to a cursory knowledge of networking. Radar Fundamentals explored the many different types of radar and the basic principles by which they operate. The phrase a radar is a radar is a radar was constantly repeated, but each new system looked more foreign than the last. Though that may have been because we kept looking at more and more recent systems as we progressed. It was interesting to see the way that radars have developed over the years. 

Radars work on a set of simple principals. The radar will transmit a propagate a signal into space via electromagnetism and focus it out at a particular bit of space in the sky. It will then listen for any shifted versions of the signal that it sent out and based on how the signal shifts, it determines what is out there in the sky. This information is then taken as the raw shifted signal and then is processed and displayed onto a screen by a rather simple principal. The longer it takes to get a response, the further out the object is.
